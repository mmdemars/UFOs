# UFOs
## Purpose
This site provides searchable parameters for UFO sightings across the US (and two signtings in Canada) throughout the month of January in 2010. Sightings can be searched by date, city, state, country and the shape of the UFO spotted. It is hoped that the data provided can help inquisitive minds reach a logical assumption about the *reality* of UFO's in the world.

## Results
A search can easily be preformed by entered the search parameter into the relevent data field on the leftheand side of the page. One the text field has been entered the dataset will automatically filter itself.

## Summary
Several drawbacks exist withint he page: the dataset is limited to a single month of a single year, the duration of the signtings is inconsistently formatted making it heard to search, and there are no references to images for what were visual sightings. Further development could include:
- ability to sort the table by date and/or duration
- ability to search the comments for words
- change shape to a dropdown selection of options
